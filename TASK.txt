Project Task: Predictive Analysis — Supply Chain & Demand Forecasting

Objective:
Build and demonstrate a predictive analytics pipeline that forecasts future demand (Sales)
using historical data and machine learning models. The focus is on data modelling, handling,
manipulation, training, evaluation, and producing a reproducible deliverable.

Requirements:
1. Use the provided sample dataset (data/trend_data.csv) or replace it with real data.
2. Preprocess data: handle missing values, encode categorical features, and scale numerical features.
3. Train at least three models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost (optional if available).
4. Evaluate models using MAE, RMSE, and R². Save the trained Random Forest model and scaler to models/.
5. Provide a CLI entrypoint (src/predictive_analysis.py) to train (--train) and predict (--predict --input).
6. Include instructions in README.md for setup, training, and prediction.
7. Optional: include visualizations, feature importance, and a short analysis of results.

Deliverables in this repository:
- data/trend_data.csv : sample synthetic dataset (monthly)
- src/predictive_analysis.py : main script for training and prediction
- models/ : directory where saved models will be stored after training
- README.md : project description and quickstart
- requirements.txt : dependencies
- TASK.txt : this task description

Notes:
- Run `python src/predictive_analysis.py --train` to train and create models/.
- Run `python src/predictive_analysis.py --predict --input '{"Marketing_Spend":50000,"Economic_Index":98.7,"Season_Summer":1,"Season_Winter":0}'` to get a sample prediction.
