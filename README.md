Predictive Analysis — Data Modelling, Handling, and Manipulation
Definition
Predictive analysis involves using statistical techniques, data mining, and machine learning models to analyze current and historical data in order to make predictions about future outcomes. This phase focuses on preparing, transforming, and modeling data to extract meaningful patterns and insights that support data-driven decision-making.

Key Components
Data Handling and Manipulation
Import and integrate data from multiple sources.
Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
Perform data cleaning, transformation, and normalization.
Create new derived features through feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summarize and understand the structure of data.
Identify correlations, distributions, and relationships among variables.
Detect patterns, trends, and anomalies within the dataset.
Use visual and statistical techniques for deeper insight.

Data Modelling
Split data into training and testing subsets.
Apply suitable machine learning algorithms for prediction.
Train and validate models using appropriate metrics.
Optimize models through parameter tuning and evaluation.

Model Evaluation and Interpretation
Measure performance using metrics such as accuracy, RMSE, or F1-score.
Interpret model coefficients or feature importance.
Assess bias, variance, and overall model reliability.
Translate predictive results into actionable insights.

Tools and Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Environment: Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

Outcome
The result of this phase is a structured, high-quality dataset and a validated predictive model that can forecast trends, identify risks, and support data-driven decisions with greater accuracy.
